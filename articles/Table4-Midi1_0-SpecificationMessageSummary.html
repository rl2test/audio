    <TD>Control Change.<BR>This message is sent when a controller value 
      changes. Controllers include devices such as pedals and levers. Certain 
      controller numbers are reserved for specific purposes. See Channel Mode 
      Messages.<BR>(ccccccc) is the controller number.<BR>(vvvvvvv) is the new

    <TD>1101nnnn</TD>
    <TD>0ccccccc</TD>
    <TD>Channel Pressure (After-touch).<BR>This message is sent when the 
      channel pressure changes. Some velocity-sensing keyboards do not support 
      polyphonic after-touch. Use this message to send the single greatest 
      velocity (of all the current depressed keys).<BR>(ccccccc) is the channel 
      number.</TD></TR>

    <TD>0lllllll<BR>0mmmmmmm</TD>
    <TD>Pitch Wheel Change.<BR>This message is sent to indicate a change in 
      the pitch wheel. The pitch wheel is measured by a fourteen bit value. 
      Center (no pitch change) is 2000H. Sensitivity is a function of the 
      transmitter.<BR>(llllll) are the least significant 7 bits.<BR>(mmmmmm) are 
      the most significant 7 bits.</TD></TR>

    <TD>Channel Mode Messages.<BR>This the same code as the Control Change 
      (above), but implements Mode control by using reserved controller numbers. 
      The numbers are:
      <P>Local Control.<BR>When Local Control is Off, all devices on a given 
      channel will respond only to data received over MIDI. Played data, etc. 
      will be ignored. Local Control On restores the functions of the normal 
      controllers.<BR>c = 122, v = 0: Local Control Off<BR>c = 122, v = 127: 
      Local Control On
      <P>All Notes Off.<BR>When an All Notes Off is received, all oscillators 
      will turn off.<BR>c = 123, v = 0: All Notes Off<BR>(See text for 
      description of actual mode commands.)<BR>c = 124, v = 0: Omni Mode 
      Off<BR><BR>c = 125, v = 0: Omni Mode On<BR>c = 126, v = M: Mono Mode On 
      (Poly Off) where M is the number of channels<BR>(Omni Off) or 0 (Omni 
      On)<BR>c = 127, v = 0: Poly Mode On (Mono Off)<BR>(Note: These four 
      messages also cause All Notes Off) </P>

    <TD>System Exclusive.<BR>This message makes up for all that MIDI doesn't 
      support. (iiiiiii) is a seven bit Manufacturer's I.D. code. If the 
      synthesizer recognizes the I.D. code as its own, it will listen to the 
      rest of the message (ddddddd). Otherwise, the message will be ignored. 
      System Exclusive is used to send bulk dumps such as patch parameters and 
      other non-spec data. (Note: Real-Time messages ONLY may be interleaved 
      with a System Exclusive.)</TD></TR>

    <TD>Song Position Pointer.<BR>This is an internal 14 bit register that

    <TD>Active Sensing. Use of this message is optional. When initially sent, 
      the receiver will expect to receive another Active Sensing message each 
      300ms (max), or it will be assume that the connection has been terminated. 
      At termination, the receiver will turn off all voices and return to normal 
      (non-active sensing) operation.</TD></TR>

    <TD>Reset.<BR>Reset all receivers in the system to power-up status. This 
      should be used sparingly, preferably under manual control. In particular, 
      it should not be sent on power-up.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
